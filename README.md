Credit Card Approval Prediction Project
This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting credit card approval using machine learning techniques. The project aims to assist banks in assessing the creditworthiness of applicants, thereby improving decision-making processes and reducing financial risks.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

data: This directory contains the dataset used for analysis and modeling.

Credit_Card.csv: Main dataset containing customer information.
Credit_card_label.csv: Dataset containing credit approval labels.
notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks detailing the data analysis and machine learning pipeline.

1_Data_Exploration.ipynb: Notebook for data exploration and visualization.
2_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb: Notebook for data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
3_Machine_Learning_Modeling.ipynb: Notebook for implementing machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
4_SQL_Analysis.ipynb: Notebook for performing SQL queries on the cleaned dataset.
scripts: This directory contains any custom Python scripts used in the project.
